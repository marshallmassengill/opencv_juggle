OpenCV Testing

Goal is to write a program to track balls being juggled in the movie.  Eventually this will unload to a GPU for faster computation rather than being purely CPU bound.  

This will be used as reference code to support a FIRST robotics team when all is said and done.  They will expand this code to pull images from either one or multiple webcams for competition.
